Interactive Dashboard creation of belly button biodiversity

Introduction
The goal of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.  The dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  The dashboard will concentrate on Operational taxonomix units, or OTUs.  OTUs are a small number of microbial species that were present in 70% of the study population.  The other microbial species found were relatively rare.
